Hello, my name is Xiaojing Zhuo. You can also call me Hester. I am majoring in Conference Interpreting and Translation (Chinese-English). I have worked as a part-time translator since June 2016, rendering many materials both from Chinese to English and from English to Chinese. There are the links to my CV and LinkedIn page:
